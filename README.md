# PhoneticsFlaschards
Scripts to prepare certain datasets, notebooks, and other related code for learning phonetics through a flashcard-like system.

Accordingly, this github repo contains three folders: PyScripts, Notebooks, and ShellScripts.

## Instructions
The first thing to do is prepare a dataset. My scripts and notebooks work best with the Dutch diphones dataset found here () or the English diphones dataset found here ().
